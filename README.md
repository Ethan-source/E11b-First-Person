The purpose of this project was to excercise our knowledge of the 3D world in godot and try and make a simple character design for a first person shooter game. Throughout the process of creating this assignment, I have learned how to create a "character model" how to create a moveable camera in a 3D space, and the intricities of the 3D nodes. To make my map slightly different, I have added some extra platforms to jump around on.
